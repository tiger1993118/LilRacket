# LilRacket
Some random racket functions that I write for fun and some past project that I have fun with

These functions and projects come from different sources and aim for different purposes
- Some of them are from courses, or school projects(I will credit and link them to where it from)
- Some of them are helper functions, which are kept for future reference
- The rest of them are just for fun or practice purpose


But the bottom line is - I love Racket and enjoy playing with them from time to time :)
